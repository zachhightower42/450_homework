# Conditions
I am writing a program using Scheme in the program DrRacket. It needs to accomplish the following problem statement
# Problem statement
Write a program with the following functions defined: • countAtomInList. This function should take an integer and an integer list as parameters and returns the occurrences of the integer in the list. • squareTheList. This function accepts an integer list as a parameter and squares each ele- ment in the list. • evenInList. This function accepts an integer list as a parameter and returns the even num- bers in the list.

```
# Example output
> (countAtomInList '2 '(1 2 3 4 2 2 2))
4
> (squareTheList '(1 2 3 4 5)) 
'(1 4 9 16 25) 
> (evenInList '(1 2 3 4 5)) 
'(2 4)
```
