## Homework 9

### Problem 1, Fill in the Blank, T/F
**NOTE:** Answers are in **bold** text
1. The design of the functional languages is based on **lambda calculus**.
2. Expressions in Scheme are automatically interpreted by the function **eval**.
3. **car** is the function that returns the first element in a list.
4. **compose** is a functional form that takes two functions as parameters and yields a function whose value is the first actual parameter function applied to the application of the second.
5. **Map** is a functional form that takes a single function as a parameter and yields a list of values obtained by applying the given function to each element of a list of parameters.
6. In a functional programming language, the evaluation of a function always produces the same result given the same parameters. This feature is called **referential transparency**.
7. Operators in Scheme (like +, -, *, /, etc.) are **prefix**.
8. **T**: In Scheme, lambda expressions are used to describe nameless functions.
9. **T**: The programming language Python supports some functional programming features.
10. **F**: Generally speaking, functional languages have more complex syntax and semantics than imperative languages.

### Problem 2: (5 pts)

Finish the Scheme program, and make sure to include the header comments (check Program Template on Bb). **If your program does not execute, you will get NO credit.**
